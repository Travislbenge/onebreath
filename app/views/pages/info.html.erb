          One Breath was named after the saying that one mindful breath is all it takes to change your day to the better, we wholeheartedly believe that, that's why
          we focus on the breaks as much as the work.

          Our timer uses timeboxing technique made famous by the pomodoro timer and Cal Newport's Deep Work. The basic logic is to
          set time to focus times time to take breaks or get distracted. This way one can focus on one thing at a time and get the most done.
